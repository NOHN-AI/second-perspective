"""Human / expert panel protocols & aggregation (module B, v0.6).

Dimension 7 (domain expertise), dimension 8 (κ > 0.70 human scoring) and ethics
review are **human judgements**. Consistent with the NOMOS kernel, this layer
does not let the engine adjudicate: it defines protocols and a deterministic
aggregation surface, and treats human input as an explicit, attributable input.
Concrete panels are supplied by the operating body.

Implemented here
----------------
- ``aggregate_panel_agreement`` — Fleiss' kappa over expert scores.
- ``aggregate_by_dimension``    — per-dimension agreement.
- ``kappa_metric_result``       — agreement expressed as a ``MetricResult`` so it
  plugs straight into the measurement layer's ``methodology-control`` pack.
