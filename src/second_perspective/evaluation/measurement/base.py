"""Evaluation measurement layer — metric & result protocols (v0.6).

This module defines the *interfaces* the measurement harness is built on:

- ``MetricResult`` — every metric returns one of these (value + optional
  threshold verdict + evidence metadata), mirroring NOMOS' invariant that a
  number is never reported without its provenance.
- ``Metric`` — a lightweight structural protocol for pluggable metrics.
- ``MetricError`` — raised when a metric is handed input it cannot compute on.

Design invariants (aligned with the NOMOS kernel):

- Determinism: a metric is a pure function of its declared inputs.
- No invention: metrics never impute missing observations; they raise instead.
- Provenance: results carry ``n`` (sample size) and ``meta`` for re-computation.
