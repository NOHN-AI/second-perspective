"""Institution product & operations protocols (module C — placeholders, v0.6).

Covers the operating-body surface: public leaderboard, deep-report portal,
appeal workflow, and version-drift monitoring scheduling. Each is declared as a
Protocol with a minimal dataclass model; concrete implementations (hosting,
database, cron) are operational concerns living outside the deterministic kernel.

Status: interface placeholder. The dataclasses here are usable as-is; the
Protocols describe what an operating body must implement.
