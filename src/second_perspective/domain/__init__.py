"""Domain control packs (v0.5).

A DomainControlPack encodes domain-specific guardrails (regulatory thresholds,
mandatory disclosures, hard constraints) that sit *outside* the deterministic
engine. Packs never alter the engine's verdict; they surface violations as
warnings and, optionally, block sealing when ``fail_on_violation`` is enabled on
the service. This keeps the engine's "never invent" invariant intact while
allowing operators to attach compliance policy.
